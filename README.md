# neural-notwork
End goal should be a basic neural network written from scratch. Intended final project should be able to predict letters from images of handwritten ones.

# Intended Functionality
I intend to develop a modular neural network class that can be applied to different problems.
The initial goal is to use the network on the common [Handwritten Digit Dataset](https://data-flair.training/blogs/handwritten-character-recognition-neural-network/)
